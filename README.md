Play Store App review Analysis : 

The aim of this project is to analyze two datasets related to the Google Play Store, one containing app metadata such as category, rating, and installs, and another containing user reviews with sentiment analysis. My objective is to identify key factors for app engagement and success by analyzing patterns and correlations in the data with the phython libraries.
